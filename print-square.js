function printSquare(size) {
  for (var i = 0; i < size; i++)
  console.log("*******");
}

console.log(printSquare(5))
//thought that would work...how do i get javascript to make columns? Do I have to use the number of asterisks that I need, or is there a way to tell the function the number of asterisks I need?
